# Hello Everyone!ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Ariel! [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/58fc218d-2787-4807-ae21-42dfd1b61bae/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-arielcjwe/deploys)

### Information

This project was meant to teach me the inner workings of webdevelopment and how to create a website from the groud up. It also assisted in teaching me more about color theory along with being more considerate of those with disabilities. The project itself although it was hard understanding a few concepts such as flexbox, it does allow one to appreciate even the most simple websites out there as it takes a lot of time and creativity to create anything. I was especially intrigued with the navigation bar and the contact us form as it still amazes me the information that is being collected.

### Inspired Colors

Working with colors that are mindful of the visually impaired was hard but worth it. Ths colors used throughout the project would be: #390F8A, dark grey, #BD874D, #F2DDB8, brown, #7A92F0, black and #A36D0E.

### Nav-Bar
The Nav bar is a bit bigger than most as it is catered towards the visually impaired. The bar once is on a smaller screen size will change to a hamburger menu where the user can access the menu from there then close off the menu when they do not need to use it anymore.
